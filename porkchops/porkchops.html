    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>These breaded pork chops, made in the air fryer, are perfectly tender and juicy. They require basic pantry ingredients and take just 10 minutes to cook. I like to use a Misto sprayer with my own oil, but feel free to use regular cooking spray.</p>
    <p> <strong>Prep:</strong>10 mins </p>
    <p> <strong>Cook</strong> 10 mins</strong></p>
    <p> <strong> Total: </strong> 20 mins </p>
    <p> <strong> Servings </strong> 4 </p>
    <h3> INGREDIENTS </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 4 (5 ounce) boneless, center-cut pork chops, 1-inch thick</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li> 1 ½ cups cheese and garlic croutons</li>
        <li> 2 large eggs</li>
        <li> cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> <strong> STEPS</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p> <strong> STEP 1</strong></p> 
        <p> Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><p> <strong> STEP 2</strong></p>
        <p> Place pork chops on a plate and season both sides with Cajun seasoning. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients. Fill a cookie press or pastry bag with dough, and form cookies on an ungreased cookie sheet.</p></li>
        <li><p> <strong> STEP 3</strong></p>
        <p> Pulse croutons in a small food processor until fine; transfer to a shallow dish. Lightly beat eggs in a separate shallow dish. Working one at a time, dip pork chops into beaten egg, letting excess drip off; press into crouton breading to coat both sides and place breaded chop, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with remaining chops. Mist chops with cooking spray.</p></li>
        <li> <p> <strong> Step 4</strong></p>
        <p> Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray and arrange chops in a single layer in the air fryer basket. You may have to do two batches depending on the size of your air fryer.</p></li>
        <li> <p> Step 5</p>
        <p> Cook in the preheated air fryer for 5 minutes; flip chops and mist again with cooking spray if there are dry areas. Cook 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chops should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</p></li>
